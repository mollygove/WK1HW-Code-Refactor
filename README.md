# WK1HW-Code-Refactor

We have updated the code by refacorting what was already written. 

- I have elimated most of the divs and replaced them.
- This project was enacted to solve accessability standards.
- I have a better understanding how to read someone else's code and how difficult it can be without comments or semantic HTML. 

The Goal was to keep the page the same while:
1. Webpage meets accessibility standards.
2. Source code is viewable.
3. HTML elements are semantic.
4. HTML elements are structured.
5. Elements follow a l.ogical structure independent of styling and positioning.
6. Icon and image elements are viewable.
7. Alt attributes are accessable..
8. Heading attributes are viewable and fall in sequential order.
9. Title element is viewable.
10. Title is concise, descriptive.
