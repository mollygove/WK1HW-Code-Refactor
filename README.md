# WK1HW-Code-Refactor
## Description

We have updated the code by refacorting what was already written. 

- I have elimated most of the divs and replaced them 
- This project was enacted to solve accessability standards
- I have a better understanding how to read someone else code and how difficult it can be without comments or semantic HTML.

2. Source code is viewable.
3. HTML elements are semantic.
4. HTML elements are structured.
5. Elements follow a l.ogical structure independent of styling and positioning.

10. Title is concise, descriptive.
