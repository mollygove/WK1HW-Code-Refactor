# WK1HW-Code-Refactor
## Description

We have updated the code by refacorting what was already written. 

- I have elimated most of the divs and replaced them 
- This project was enacted to solve accessability standards
- I have a better understanding how to read someone else code and how difficult it can be without comments or semantic HTML.
